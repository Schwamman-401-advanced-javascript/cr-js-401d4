### Engineering Topics

Each of the readings focused on efficiently solving problems but each noted several different tips on how to be successful. The most important step to solving a complicated problem is to take the time to understand the problem well. For example, if given a coding challenge in an interview make sure to read the problem 2 or more times. For more complex problems you could also utilize the "5 whys and 5 hows" to focus on why there's a problem and how it can be resolve. Once you have a good understanding of the problem, to actually solve it you'll need some kind of plan. One way of doing this is to first try and manually solve the problem. With the manual solution you can then write out the steps in pseudo code and translate that to real code. However, if a problem seems to difficult to solve all at once it can also be helpful to divide the solution into simpler sections. This allows you to tackle smaller problems one at a time and then connect the parts to get the full solution.
